# Django CBV ToDoApp CRUD

A simple ToDo application built using Django, demonstrating the use of class-based views (CBVs) for implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This application allows users to manage tasks through a user-friendly interface, with full functionality for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with a title and description.
- **Read Tasks**: View a list of tasks with their details.
- **Update Tasks**: Edit an existing task's title and description.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Class-Based Views**: Implements CRUD operations using Django's CBVs for better modularity and reuse.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Django**: The main framework used for the project.
- **SQLite** (default database for Django, can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahramsamar/Django_Cbv_ToDoApp_CRUD.git
    cd Django_Cbv_ToDoApp_CRUD
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    If you're using `pip`, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Apply Migrations**:

    Run the following command to set up the database schema:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Create a Superuser (Admin)**:

    To manage tasks via the admin panel:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

5. **Run the Development Server**:

    Start the development server with:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
